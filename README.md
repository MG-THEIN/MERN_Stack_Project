# Ticketing & Notes App
First of all I would like to say about where did I get this project idea. The idea for this web-app came from my uncle, who runs a small phone repair shop. They were using sticky notes to jot down info about services and products on customer devices. Total chaos, right? Notes were getting lost, and nobody knew who wrote what. It was a real mess.So, I took matters into my own hands and created a no-nonsense web-app for centralized ticketing and note-taking.

## Tools Used in this project
I've done multiple frontend and backend projects, and looking to do a full stack project in order to get a clear understanding of how the frontend and backend connect to each other.So I decided to do this project using MERN stack.

We developed a backend rest api in MVC design pattern using `Node.js`, `Express.js`, and `MangoDB` as database. For the frontend, we use `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`, `React` and `Redux`. We also use `JWT tokens` for autentication and securely transferring data between sever and client.
